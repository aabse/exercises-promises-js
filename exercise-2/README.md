Let's do a harder exercise. In this code, your function receives a parameter data. You must modify the code below based on the following rules:

- Your function must always return a promise
- If data is not a number, return a promise rejected instantly and give the data "error" (in a string)
- If data is an odd number, return a promise resolved 1 second later and give the data "odd" (in a string)
- If data is an even number, return a promise rejected 2 seconds later and give the data "even" (in a string)
